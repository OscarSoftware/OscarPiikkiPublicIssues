        - PDFs are no longer converted to images in backend, and they can be viewed inside the app
      - Image manipulation
        - Perspective cropping
        - Black and white image

# 19.2.1 Release notes
 - What's new:
      - PDF Preview
        - User can preview PDFs as they are converted to images in cloud and fetched by the app.
      - Default screen on startup
        - User can select a default startup screen from settings. When the app starts it opens to this screen. 
      - General data updating logic improved
        - CRUD-operations more reliable as there are global providers and functions for state access/manipulation.
        - Data is always up to date as changes are reflected globally. 
      - Styling changes
        - Settings screen redesigned.
        - More loadingcomponents/toasts added and loading icon changed.
        - Toast component redesigned. Automatical stacking and onPress dismiss. Also removed buggy layoutanimation.
      - Permormance improvements
        - Receipt images were previously fetched individually for each receipt. Loading/updating of receipts is now much  
          quicker as images are bulk fetched.
        - User has quicker access to new data when switching between screens as the data is now updated in background
          when changes happen. 
      - iOS Logout works 
        - User couldn't logout without clearing cache. 
 - Known issues: 
     - PDFs can only be viewed individually
        - User cannot view PDFs and images simultaneously inside preview carousel. When user clicks on a PDF-icon, only 
          the PDF pages are shown. Normal images have to be viewed separately. 
     

# 19.2.0 Release notes
 - What's new:
      - Statistics screen added
        - User can see how many sent, unhandled and unsent receipts there are
        - User can browse costs by target 
      - Unhandled receipt status code change to "KASITTELEMATON"
      - Default account can be selected from settings
      - Receipts in UI are mostly updated through SQLite
        - Receipts are synced from cloud to SQLite once during startup
        - When user slides to refresh, receipts are synced again from cloud to SQLite
        - Receipt updates, additions and deletions don't cause full cloud refresh, only individual sync to SQLite
      - Perfomance updates
        - Opening filters has no more lag
        - Receipt search view initially shows only 10 receipts but more receipts can be loaded from the button below the list
        - Changing of screens happens much faster as screen updates are only done when necessary
      - Camerascreen improvements
        - Transparent screen when taking picture
        - Shutter click sound on android
      - PDF upload support
        - As of now previewing PDF inside app not possible. Shows only an icon
      - Receipt can have negative price
      - Correct user account details shown in settings screen
 - Known issues: 
     - If a screen is loading something, user should wait for loading to finish before proceeding to next page
        - Can cause out of sync data -> slide to refresh to update again. 
     - If user data fetch fails (accounts, targets, payment methods and currencies) there is no way to update the data but to  reboot the app
     - As uploading receipt data and images don't happen on a single transaction, it is theoretically possible to manage
       to upload a receipt without images.
